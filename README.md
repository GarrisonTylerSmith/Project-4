# Project-4 raytracer
adding reflectivity , refractivity and IOR
In this project I was about to get specular and shadow to do something however it does not do what it is suppose to do. 
The other thing is that I do have a reflection and refraction fuctions in my code
Also to compile my code I just compiled it off the raytracer.c I know it is bad coding but that is how I compiled it 
Also I did include a makefile if you are able to compile it from there you can try
